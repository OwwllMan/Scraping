# The Hacking Project - 


## ðŸ“° The content
In these exercises, I had to do scrapping for :
* Retrieve emails from the town halls of a department on https://www.annuaire-des-mairies.com/
* Retrieve the price of cryptocurrencies on Coinmarketcap (https://coinmarketcap.com/)
* Retrieve all the email addresses of the French deputies.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd Scraping
$ bundle install
```
This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
